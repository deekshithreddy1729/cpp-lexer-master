# cpp-lexer
This project is a simple lexer with some parser experimental elements.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to learn the basic of lexing and parsing. Lexing and parsing are important to compiler programming, but can also be applied to other projects which require processing of user input. e.g. in-app console/debugger. 

### Warning
This was a learning project, sometimes going down to very low level programming, the idea was to write everything I needed from scratch and not rely on modern libraries (std or otherwise), and using only the stdio.h library to get our input from the console. 

## Building
Build using build.bat in misc if you have Visual Studio 2017 installed. Otherwise use your own compiler and build config.
